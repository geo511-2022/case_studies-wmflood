##The tables for the nycflights13 are flights, airports, planes, weather, airlines

View(flights)
View(airports)

flights_arrange = arrange(flights, desc(distance)) ##this arranged the data in descending order based on the distance column

flights_slice = slice(flights_arrange, 1) ##this sliced the table so that only the first row was kept

farthest_airport = 
  left_join(flights_slice, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>% ##kept the flights_slice data set and joined the other columns from the airports table
  select(name) %>% ##this selected the name column
  as.character() ##this wrote the name column as characters so that farthest_airport was assigned to the value
